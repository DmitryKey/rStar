### Instruction:
If $3p+4q=8$ and $4p+3q=13$, what is $q$ equal to?

### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Start with the equations $3p + 4q = 8$ and $4p + 3q = 13$.
Step 2: Eliminate $p$ by making the coefficients of $p$ equal in both equations. Multiply the first equation by 4 and the second by 3 to get $12p + 16q = 32$ and $12p + 9q = 39$.
Step 3: Subtract the second equation from the first to cancel out $p$, resulting in $7q = -7$.
Step 4: Divide both sides by 7 to solve for $q$, giving $q = -1$.
Step 5: The answer is: -1.

### Instruction:
The Smith family has 4 sons and 3 daughters. In how many ways can they be seated in a row of 7 chairs such that at least 2 boys are next to each other?

### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Recognize the complexity of calculating directly and opt for complementary counting.
Step 2: Identify the only seating arrangement that avoids two boys next to each other as alternating genders (BGBGBGB).
Step 3: Calculate the arrangements for this pattern, $4! \times 3! = 144$, which are undesirable.
Step 4: Subtract these from the total unrestricted seatings, $7! = 5040$, to get $5040 - 144 = 4896$.
Step 5: The answer is: 4896.

### Instruction:
A square and four circles, each with a radius of 5 inches, are arranged as shown. What is the area, in square inches, of the square? [asy]\nunitsize(1mm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7pt));\n\ndraw((0,0)--(20,0)--(20,20)--(0,20)--cycle);\ndraw(Circle((5,5),5));\ndraw(Circle((15,5),5));\ndraw(Circle((5,15),5));\ndraw(Circle((15,15),5));\n[/asy]

### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Recognize that each circle has a radius of 5 inches.
Step 2: The diameter of each circle is 10 inches, and the square must fit two diameters along each side.
Step 3: Calculate the side length of the square as $10$ inches (one diameter) + $10$ inches (second diameter) = $20$ inches.
Step 4: The area of the square is then $20 \times 20 = 400$ square inches.
Step 5: The answer is: 400.

### Instruction:
Given that $a$ is a multiple of $1428$, find the greatest common divisor of $a^2+9a+24$ and $a+4$.

### Response:
Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Start with the expressions $a^2 + 9a + 24$ and $a + 4$.
Step 2: Use the Euclidean Algorithm. Subtract $(a + 5)(a + 4)$ from $a^2 + 9a + 24$, simplifying to $a^2 + 9a + 24 - (a^2 + 9a + 20) = 4$.
Step 3: Now find $\text{gcd}(4, a+4)$. As $4$ divides $1428$, it also divides $a$ and thus $a+4$.
Step 4: The greatest common divisor is $4$.
Step 5: The answer is: 4.
