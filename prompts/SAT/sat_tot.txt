Question: Simplify and write the result with a rational denominator: $$\sqrt{\sqrt[3]{\sqrt{\frac{1}{729}}}}$$
A. $\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{3}$
B. $\frac{1}{3}$ 
C. $\sqrt{3}$ 
D. $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$
Step 1: Simplify the innermost radical first, $\sqrt{\frac{1}{729}}$: $$\sqrt{\frac{1}{729}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{27^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{27^2}} = \frac{1}{27}$$.
Step 2: Next, simplify the cube root of $\frac{1}{27}$: $$\sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{27}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{27}} = \frac{1}{3}$$.
Step 3: Finally, simplify the square root of $\frac{1}{3}$: $$\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{1}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$$.
Step 4: Rationalize the denominator: $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{1 \cdot \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$$.
Step 5: The answer is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$.
Step 6: The answer is D.

Question: Five thousand dollars compounded annually at an $x\%$ interest rate takes six years to double. At the same interest rate, how many years will it take \$300 to grow to \$9600?
A. 12 
B. 1 
C. 30 
D. 5
Step 1: First, we need to determine the interest rate $x$. We know that \$5000 doubles to \$10000 in six years. Using the formula for compound interest: $$ A = P(1 + \frac{r}{100})^t $$ where $A$ is the final amount, $P$ is the principal amount, $r$ is the interest rate, and $t$ is the time in years. For the amount to double: $$ 10000 = 5000(1 + \frac{x}{100})^6 $$ $$ 2 = (1 + \frac{x}{100})^6 $$.
Step 2: To find $x$, take the sixth root of both sides: $$ 1 + \frac{x}{100} = 2^{1/6} $$ $$ \frac{x}{100} = 2^{1/6} - 1 $$ $$ x = 100(2^{1/6} - 1) $$.
Step 3: Now, using the same interest rate $x$, we need to find out how many years it will take for \$300 to grow to \$9600. $$ 9600 = 300(1 + \frac{x}{100})^t $$ $$ 32 = (1 + \frac{x}{100})^t $$.
Step 4: Using the value $1 + \frac{x}{100} = 2^{1/6}$: $$ 32 = (2^{1/6})^t $$ $$ 32 = 2^{t/6} $$ Since $32 = 2^5$: $$ 2^5 = 2^{t/6} $$ $$ 5 = \frac{t}{6} $$ $$ t = 30 $$.
Step 5: The answer is C.

Question: Ten students take a biology test and receive the following scores: 45, 55, 50, 70, 65, 80, 40, 90, 70, 85. What is the mean of the students test scores?
A. 55 
B. 60 
C. 62 
D. 65
Step 1: Add all the scores together: $45 + 55 + 50 + 70 + 65 + 80 + 40 + 90 + 70 + 85 = 650$.
Step 2: Divide the total by the number of students: $\frac{650}{10} = 65$.
Step 3: The answer is D.

Question: The variable $x$ varies directly as the square of $y$, and $y$ varies directly as the cube of $z$. If $x$ equals $-16$ when $z$ equals 2, what is the value of $x$ when $z$ equals \(\frac{1}{2}\)?
A. -1 
B. 16 
C. -\frac{1}{256} 
D. \frac{1}{16}
Step 1: Since $x$ varies directly as the square of $y$, we can write $x = k_1 y^2$ for some constant $k_1$.
Step 2: Since $y$ varies directly as the cube of $z$, we can write $y = k_2 z^3$ for some constant $k_2$.
Step 3: Substituting $y = k_2 z^3$ into $x = k_1 y^2$, we get $x = k_1 (k_2 z^3)^2 = k_1 k_2^2 z^6$.
Step 4: We know that $x = -16$ when $z = 2$. Substituting these values in, we get $-16 = k_1 k_2^2 (2^6)$. 
Step 5: Simplifying, $-16 = k_1 k_2^2 \cdot 64$.
Step 6: Solving for $k_1 k_2^2$, we get $k_1 k_2^2 = \frac{-16}{64} = -\frac{1}{4}$.
Step 7: Now we need to find the value of $x$ when $z = \frac{1}{2}$. Using $x = k_1 k_2^2 z^6$ and substituting $k_1 k_2^2 = -\frac{1}{4}$ and $z = \frac{1}{2}$, we get $x = -\frac{1}{4} (\frac{1}{2})^6$.
Step 8: Simplifying, $x = -\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{64} = -\frac{1}{256}$.
Step 9: The answer is C.

Question: Joe was in charge of lights for a dance. The red light blinks every two seconds, the yellow light every three seconds, and the blue light every five seconds. If we include the very beginning and very end of the dance, how many times during a seven minute dance will all the lights come on at the same time? (Assume that all three lights blink simultaneously at the very beginning of the dance.)
A. 3 
B. 15 
C. 6 
D. 5
Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the blinking intervals of the red, yellow, and blue lights. The LCM of 2, 3, and 5 is 30 seconds.
Step 2: Determine the total duration of the dance in seconds: 7 minutes = 7 \times 60 = 420 seconds.
Step 3: Calculate how many times the lights blink together in 420 seconds. They blink together every 30 seconds.
Step 4: Divide the total duration by the LCM: \(\frac{420}{30} = 14\).
Step 5: Include the very beginning of the dance, so the total number of times is 14 + 1 = 15.
Step 6: The answer is B.
