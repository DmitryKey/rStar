Given an Original Question and a Model Response, please analyze if Model Response correctly answer Original Question, and provide an Evaluation. Finally, you should provide a evaluation score for model response between 0 and 1. End your Evaluation with "The answer is".

Original Question: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?
Model Response: Let's think step by step. There are 15 trees originally. Then there were 21 trees after some more were planted. So there must have been 21 - 15 = 6. The answer is: 6.
Evaluation: The response is accurate and the steps are clearly explained. It correctly identifies the number of trees planted. The answer is 1.

Original Question: If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?
Model Response: Let's think step by step. There are 3 cars initially and 2 more arrive, so the total is 3 + 2 = 5. The answer is: 5.
Evaluation: The response is accurate but very straightforward. The clarity is good, but the simplicity of the problem means it doesn't need much explanation. The answer is 0.9.

Original Question: Leah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42. If they ate 35, how many pieces do they have left in total?
Model Response: Let's think step by step. Leah had 32 chocolates, and her sister had 42. Together, they ate 35, so they have 32 - 35 = -3 chocolates left. The answer is: -3.
Evaluation: The response contains a critical error in the subtraction. The chocolates eaten should be subtracted from the total chocolates, not individually. The correct calculation is (32 + 42) - 35 = 39. The answer is 0.

Original Question: Jason had 20 lollipops. He gave Denny some lollipops. Now Jason has 12 lollipops. How many lollipops did Jason give to Denny?
Model Response: Let's think step by step. Jason had 20 lollipops and now has 12. He gave away 20 - 12 = 8 lollipops. The answer is: 8.
Evaluation: The response is accurate, but it could benefit from a bit more explanation on how the subtraction relates to the number of lollipops given away. The answer is 0.9.

Original Question: Shawn has five toys. For Christmas, he got two toys each from his mom and dad. How many toys does he have now?
Model Response: Let's think step by step. Shawn originally had 5 toys. He got 2 more from his mom and 2 from his dad, so he has 5 + 2 + 2 = 10 toys now. The answer is: 10.
Evaluation: The response is incorrect. The accurate calculation should be 5 + 2 + 2 = 9. The model overcounted. The answer is 0.

Original Question: There were nine computers in the server room. Five more computers were installed each day, from Monday to Thursday. How many computers are now in the server room?
Model Response: Let's think step by step. There were 9 computers initially. 5 more were added each day from Monday to Thursday, so 5 * 4 = 20 were added. Total computers now are 9 + 20 = 29. The answer is: 29.
Evaluation: The response is accurate, but the explanation could be enhanced by breaking down the multiplication step more explicitly. The answer is 0.95.

Original Question: Michael had 58 golf balls. On Tuesday, he lost 23 golf balls. On Wednesday, he lost 2 more. How many golf balls did he have at the end of Wednesday?
Model Response: Let's think step by step. Michael had 58 golf balls. He lost 23 on Tuesday and 2 on Wednesday, so he lost a total of 23 + 2 = 25. He has 58 - 25 = 33 golf balls left. The answer is: 33.
Evaluation: The response is accurate and well-explained, breaking down the total loss and remaining amount clearly. The answer is 1.

Original Question: Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?
Model Response: Let's think step by step. Olivia spent 5 * $3 = $15 on bagels. She had $23 initially, so she has $23 - $15 = $7 left. The answer is: 7.
Evaluation: The response has an arithmetic error. The correct calculation is $23 - $15 = $8. The answer is 0.
