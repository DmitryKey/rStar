Given a question and some sub-questions, determine whether the last sub-question is useful to answer the question. Output 'Yes' or 'No', and a reason.

Question 1: Four years ago, Kody was only half as old as Mohamed. If Mohamed is currently twice as 30 years old, how old is Kody?
Question 1.1: How old is Mohamed currently?
Answer 1.1: Mohamed is twice as old as 30 years, which means he is 30 * 2 = 60 years old. The answer is 60.
Question 1.2: What was Kody's age four years ago, given that it was half of Mohamed's age at that time?
Answer 1.2: Four years ago, Mohamed was 60 - 4 = 56 years old, so Kody was half of that, which is 56 / 2 = 28 years old. The answer is 28.
New question 1.3: How old was Kody four years ago?
Is the new question useful? Yes. We need the answer to calculate how old is Kody now.

Question 2: Traci and Harris are baking cakes together. Traci has brought flour from her own house and Harris has 400g of flour in his house. Each cake needs 100g of flour and Traci and Harris have created 9 cakes each. How much flour, in grams, did Traci bring from her own house?
New question 2.1: How many cakes did Traci bring from her own house?

Question 3: A quantity surveyor is figuring the construction costs for a couple that wishes to build a house. The costs are as follows: land costs $50 per square meter, bricks cost $100 per 1000 bricks and roof tiles cost $10 per roof tile. If the house they wish to build requires 2000 square meters, 10000 bricks, and 500 roof tiles, how much construction costs are required for this project?
Question 3.1: How much does the land cost?
Answer 3.1: The land cost for 2000 square meters at $50 per square meter is 2000 * 50 = $100,000. The answer is 100000.
Question 3.2: How much do the bricks cost?
Answer 3.2: The cost for 10,000 bricks at $100 per 1,000 bricks is 10,000 / 1,000 * $100 = $1,000. The answer is 1000.
New question 3.3: How much do the roof tiles cost?
Is the new question useful? Yes. We need the answer to calculate the total construction costs.

Question 4: Wallace's water heater is twice the size of Catherine's water heater. If the capacity of Wallace's water heater is 40 gallons and it's 3/4 full, calculate the total number of gallons of water they both have if Catherine's water heater is also full with water to 3/4 of its capacity.
Question 4.1: How much water is in Wallace's water heater?
Answer 4.1: Wallace's water heater, with a capacity of 40 gallons and filled to 3/4 of its capacity, holds 40 * 3/4 = 30 gallons of water. The answer is 30.
New question 4.2: How much water do they have in total?
Is the new question useful? No. It is too hard to answer the new question based on the current information.
