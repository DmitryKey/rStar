Some students in the class who are good at math are also good at chemistry. All students in the class who are good at chemistry enjoy conducting experiments. All students in the class that enjoy conducting experiments are good at planning. None of the students who are good at planning failed the class. James is a student in the class; he is either good at chemistry and failed the class, or bad at chemistry and passed the class. Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? James is good at planning.

### Response:
Let's think step by step. If James is good at chemistry, the information implies he enjoys experiments and is good at planning, which contradicts failing the class because those good at planning don't fail. If he's bad at chemistry, the information doesn't link to his planning skills. Therefore, without a clear link to his planning ability in either scenario, we cannot be certain about James's planning skills. The answer is: Uncertain.
