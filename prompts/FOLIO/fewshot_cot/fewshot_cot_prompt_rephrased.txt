Given a list of conditions, please answer the question. Condition 1: Miroslav Venhoda was a Czech choral conductor who specialized in Renaissance and Baroque music. Condition 2: Any choral conductor is considered a musician. Condition 3: Miroslav Venhoda published a book in 1946 titled "Method of Studying Gregorian Chant". Question: Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? A Czech published a book in 1946.

### Response:
Let's think step by step. Condition 1 states that Miroslav Venhoda is identified as a Czech choral conductor, and Condition 3 confirms he published a book in 1946 named "Method of Studying Gregorian Chant." Since Venhoda is Czech and he published a book in the specified year, the statement "A Czech published a book in 1946" directly follows from the provided facts. Therefore, the statement is true without any uncertainty. The answer is: True.

### Instruction:
Given a list of conditions, please answer the question. Condition 1: Some students who excel in math are also proficient in chemistry. Condition 2: All students proficient in chemistry enjoy conducting experiments. Condition 3: Students who enjoy conducting experiments are skilled at planning. Condition 4: No student skilled at planning has failed the class. Condition 5: James, a student in the class, either excels in chemistry and failed the class or is not proficient in chemistry and passed the class. Question: Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? James is good at planning.

### Response:
Let's think step by step. If James is good at chemistry, Condition 2 and 3 implies he enjoys experiments and is good at planning, which contradicts failing the class because those good at planning don't fail (Condition 4). If he's bad at chemistry, the information doesn't link to his planning skills. Therefore, without a clear link to his planning ability in either scenario, we cannot be certain about James's planning skills. The answer is: Uncertain.

### Instruction:
Given a list of conditions, please answer the question. Condition 1: Lana Wilson directed After Tiller, The Departure, and Miss Americana. Condition 2: A person who directs a film is considered a filmmaker. Condition 3: After Tiller is a documentary, which is a type of film. Condition 4: Lana Wilson is from Kirkland, and Kirkland is a US city. Condition 5: A person from a city in a country is from that country. Condition 6: After Tiller was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Documentary. Question: Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Miss Americana is not directed by a filmmaker from Kirkland.

### Response:
Let's think step by step. Condition 1 says that Lana Wilson directed After Tiller, The Departure, and Miss Americana. Since she directed a film, she is considered a filmmaker (Condition 2). By Condition 4 and 5 we know that Lana Wilson is from Kirkland, which means she is from the US. If Miss Americana was directed by Lana Wilson, it means the film was directed by a filmmaker from Kirkland. Therefore, the statement that Miss Americana is not directed by a filmmaker from Kirkland is false. The answer is: False.
